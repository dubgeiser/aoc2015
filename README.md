# Advent of Code 2015

Code is public domain and up for grabs.

## Day 8
Part 1 was kinda shortcutted by using `eval()` ;-)

## Day 9
Travelling salesman problem (TSP); try implementing other solutions.

## Day 10
Does not look that good, takes a second for 50 iterations...
Also take a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA

## Day 11
I think `sensible_reset` might be buggy and I just got lucky...
or I have shortcutted some letters without actually having thought about it.

## Day 15
Brute forcing took about 7 seconds:
142848 permutations, of which 109207 yield bad results

## Day 16
Like the simple dataclass approach of part 1
Part 2 gets a bit more involved, but still manageable
Should compare this with a version that just uses a list of 500 10 int elements
